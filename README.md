# Cs50 finance webapp
# Remember that this was my first Python project. I know that it could have been done better but it does it's job.
This project can be found on www.cosmincristescu.com, requires registration. It's a webapp based on Flask microframework and written in Python.
It represents a stock simulator. First after signning up on the
platform, the new user receives $10.000 by default. The money can be used to buy or sell stocks. The
webapp is linked with an API which is responsible for providing live and fresh stocks data. Once the stocks are bought, 
the user is able to sell them after a while to generate some profit. There are
some features like 'Quote' where the user can check stocks prices. Also there is a 'Change password'
option. And all these transactions are saved in a database and can be seen on a page named
'Transactions history'.
